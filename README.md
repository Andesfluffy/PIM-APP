This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## PIM-APP

This project provides a simple personal information manager built with Next.js and Azure Functions.

### Azure Deployment

1. **Cosmos DB** – Create a Cosmos DB account using the *MongoDB API* and enable the **Free Tier** (1000 RU/s and 25&nbsp;GB). Note the connection string and database name.
2. **Azure Functions** – Deploy the functions in `azure-functions/` to a Function App. Each function exposes an endpoint like `https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/<FUNCTION_NAME>`.
3. **Frontend** – Deploy the Next.js app to a separate App Service or Azure Static Web App.
4. **Configuration** – Set environment variables (`MONGODB_URI`, `DATABASE_NAME`, etc.) in App Service settings or store them in Azure Key Vault.

With both services deployed, the frontend can call the serverless API to manage notes, contacts and tasks stored in Cosmos DB.
